            <strong>Music</strong>
            <p>
                I took music classes for 4 years in which I learned about classical music, took singing lessons, and learned to play keyboard. I love to sing and have covered a few popular songs as well.

            <strong>Dance</strong>
            <p>
                I began to learn Kathak when I was 7 years old. I had to drop my dance classes after 8 years due to studies, but never left dance.

            <strong>True Crime</strong>
            <p>I enjoy reading about true crime stories and watching crime documentaries. It's interesting to listen to theories and trying to solve mysteries.</p>

        <li>
            <strong>Puzzles</strong>
            <p>Whenever I have time to spare, one would find me on my phone solving a sudoku or a crossword.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Badminton</strong>
            <p>I am not a fan of sports but I love playing badminton with my friends.</p>

        <li>
            <strong>Cards</strong>
            <p>
                I've been playing cards since I was a toddler. Hearts, Sweep, Solitaire, Poker, Indian Poker and Rummy are some of the card games I know.
